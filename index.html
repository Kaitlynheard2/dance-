      <p>The terms "ballet" or "balle" stem from the italian word "ballare" which means "to dance".
        dancers used to wear masks, layers of costumes, pantaloons, large headdressers and ornaments. Dancing shoes looked more formal with a small heel. They looked nothing like the modern day ballet shoe. Dances were simple an small. Not as expressive as they are in today's time.</p></p>
