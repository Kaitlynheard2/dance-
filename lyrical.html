  <p>Lyrical dance technique can trace its roots back to Russia in the first half of the 20th century. The Russian method used focuses on back strength and the fluidity of the arms. Lyrical and contemporary also really test the abilities of bodies to create many impactful emotions through sharp movements. This approach to dance helped shape lyrical dance in later decades into what it is today.</p>

Some argued that lyrical should be taught only as a version of ballet and jazz. Other teachers began teaching lyrical dance classes separately from ballet and Jazz. </p>
