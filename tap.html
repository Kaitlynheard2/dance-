    <p class = "ptap">Tap dancing originated in America at the cross roads of African and Irish American Dancing. Slave owners took away traditional African percussion instruments and slaves turned to percussive dancing in attempt to retain their cultral identity.These styles of dance connected with clog dancing from the British Isles creating a unique form of movement. </p>
    <p class = 'ptap'>Early tap shoes had wooden soles, sometimes with pennies attached to the heel and toe. Tap gained popularity after the Civil War as a part of traveling minstrel shows, where white and black performers wore blackface and belittled black people by portraying them as lazy, dumb, and comical.</p>

    <p class = "ptap">20th Century Tap Tap was an important feature of popular Vaudeville variety shows of the early 20th century and a major part of the rich creative output of the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
    <p class = "ptap">Tap dancers began collaborating with jazz musicians, incorporating improvisation and complex syncopated rhythms into their movement. The modern tap shoe, featuring metal plates (called “taps”) on the heel and toe, also came into widespread use at this time. Although Vaudeville and Broadway brought performance opportunities to African-American dancers, racism was still pervasive: white and black dancers typically performed separately and for segregated audiences.</p>
    <p class = "ptap">Tap’s popularity declined in the second half of the century, but was revitalized in the 1980s through Broadway shows like 42nd Street and The Tap Dance Kid.</p>

    <p class = "ptap"> From the 1930s to the 1950s, tap dance sequences became a staple of movies and television. Tap stars included Shirley Temple, who made her film tap dance debut at age 6, and Gene Kelly, who introduced a balletic style of tap. Fred Astaire, famous for combining tap with ballroom dance, insisted that his dance scenes be captured with a single take and wide camera angle. This style of cinematography became the norm for tap dancing in movies and television for decades.</p>
