    <p>The terms "ballet" or "balle" stem from the italian word "ballare" which means "to dance".
      dancers used to wear masks, layers of costumes, pantaloons, large headdressers and ornaments. Dancing shoes looked more formal with a small heel. They looked nothing like the modern day ballet shoe. Dances were simple an small. Not as expressive as they are in today's time.</p>
    <p>The terminology was codified in French over the next 100 years. During the reign of Louis XIV, the King performed many of the dances of the time. Once the king stoppped dancing then professional dancers were hired for court functions. </p>
    <p>Performances began to grow big and were performed on larger platforms and giant stages. in 1700-1800 people were performing in places like the War Memorial Opera House. The giant stage and the extremely tall and lengthy curtains made this place a landmark to remember.</p>

    <p> By 1850 Russia became the main country for dance and certain looks and theatrical illusions became fashionable. Dancing en poite became popular in the early part of the 19th century, with women dancing with white bell skirts that ended at their knees. Poite was only for women and this allowed for a heroine character to develop in the dance world. The recurrinng character was a sylph-like fairy whose purity triumps over all evil and impurity.</p>

    <p> The Russian theater producer, Serge Diaghilev bought the most talented dancers from the country together and formed The Ballet Russes. They toured the country and performed many ballets for large audiences. In America, ballet became popular in 1930's when several dancers left the country to conme settle in the US. George Balanchine was one of them and founded the New York City Ballet.</p>
